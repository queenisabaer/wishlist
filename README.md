### Structure 

The flowchart was crafted during the planning phase of the project and was created with [Lucid](https://lucid.app/). It still displays a third topic (Food/Drinks), that I would love to implement in the future. Furthermore, it has some additional input (smoking/alcohol) that I didn't use in the end. This could be a future enhancement.
